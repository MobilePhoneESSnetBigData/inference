\title{Computes the distribution of the population count at initial time instants using a state negative binomial
  distribution.}
\usage{
computeInitialPopulationStateNB(
  nnet,
  params,
  rndVal = FALSE,
  ciprob = NULL,
  method = "ETI"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nnet}{The random values generated with \code{aggregation} package for the number of individuals detected by the
network.}

\item{params}{The parameters of the distribution. It should be a data.table object with the following columns:
\code{region, omega1, omega2, pnrRate, regionArea_km2, N0, dedupPntRate, alpha, beta, theta, zeta, Q}.}

\item{rndVal}{If FALSE the result return by this function will be a list with a single element, a data.table object
with the following columns: \code{region, Mean, Mode, Median, SD, CV, CI_LOW, CI_HIGH}. If TRUE the list will have
a second element which is a data.table object containing the random values generated for each region.}

\item{ciprob}{Value of probability of the CI (between 0 and 1) to be estimated. If NULL the default value is 0.89.}

\item{method}{The method to compute credible intervals. It could have 2 values, 'ETI' or 'HDI'. The default value is
'ETI.}
}
\value{
A list object with one or two elements. If rndVal is FALSE the list will have a single element called stats
  which is a data.table object with the following columns: \code{region, Mean, Mode, Median, SD, CV, CI_LOW,
  CI_HIGH}. If rndVal is TRUE the list will have a second element which is a data.table object containing the random
  values generated for each region.
