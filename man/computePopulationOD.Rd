\usage{
computePopulationOD(
  nt0,
  nnetODFileName,
  zip = TRUE,
  rndVal = FALSE,
  ciprob = NULL,
  method = "ETI"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nt0}{The population at t0.}

\item{nnetODFileName}{the name of the file where the population moving from one region to another is stored. This is
an output of the \code{aggregation} package.}

\item{zip}{If TRUE the file where where the population moving from one region to another is stored is a zipped csv
file, otherwise it is  simple csv file.}

\item{rndVal}{Controls if the random values generated for each t are returned or not in the result of this function.
If TRUE, the random values generated according to the corresponding distribution are returned in the results, if
FALSE only the summary statistics for each t and region are returned.}

\item{ciprob}{Value of probability of the CI (between 0 and 1) to be estimated. If NULL the default value is 0.89.}

\item{method}{The method to compute credible intervals. It could have 2 values, 'ETI' or 'HDI'. The default value is
'ETI.}
}
\value{
A list with one element for each pair of time_from-time_to. Each element of the list is also a list with one
  or two elements, depending on the value of the rndVal parameter. If rndVal is TRUE there are two elements in the
  list corresponding to time instant a pair time_from-time_to. The first one is a data.table object with some
  descriptive statistics for the origin-destination matrix, containing the following columns:\code{region_from,
  region_to, Mean, Mode, Median, Min, Max, Q1, Q3, IQR, SD, CV, CI_LOW, CI_HIGH}. The second one is a data.table
  object with the random values for origin-destination matrix generated for each pair of time instants
  time_from-time_to and each pair of regions region_from-region_to, with the following columns: \code{region_from,
  region_to,iter, NPop}. If rndVal is FALSE the list for a pair of time instants time-from-time_to contains only the
  first element previously mentioned. The name of the list element corresponding to a pair of time instants is
  'time_from-time_to' and the name of the two list elements giving the descriptive statistics and random values for
  time t are 'stats' and 'rnd_values'.
