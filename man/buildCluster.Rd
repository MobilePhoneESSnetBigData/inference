\description{
Builds a cluster of working nodes using the \code{parallel}
  package. On Unix-like operating systems it builds as "FORK" cluster while
  on Windows it builds a "SOCKET" cluster. The number of working nodes equals
  the number of available (logical) cores as it is detected by the call of
  \code{detectCores()} function. On Windows, it also exports a list of
  variables and an environment passed as arguments. This is an internal
  function of the package, and it is not available to be direclty called by
  users.
